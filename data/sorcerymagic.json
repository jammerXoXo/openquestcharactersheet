Unlike many protective spells, Spell Resistance remains in place for the entirety of its duration – spells that successfully breach the spell do not dispel it.

        "desciption": "    There are actually seven Tap spells, one for each characteristic. These devastating spells allow the caster to permanently strip a target of characteristic points, transforming them into magic points for their own use.    The caster must make contact with the target, either physically or through Touch Projection, in order to Tap it – therefore the spell cannot be used on incorporeal creatures, such as spirits.    Tap will only work if its magnitude is equal to, or greater than, the target’s specified characteristic. Thus, a magnitude 6 Tap Strength spell would only work on targets with a STR of 6 or lower.    The number of points Tapped by the spell is equal to 1D6 per combat round the spell is applied to the victim.    Characteristic points lost to Tap are lost permanently, though the victim can raise them again through the normal means of increasing a characteristic. Characteristics may be tapped to 0, which usually involves the death of the victim (the exception being Charisma).    For each characteristic point the sorcerer Taps, they will gain one magic point. The sorcerer is limited in the number of magic points they can gain through Tap; the spell can only increase their magic points to double their normal limit. A sorcerer may simply Tap a target and dissipate any gained magic points.    If the sorcerer gains more magic points through Tap than their normal maximum, the points will disappear at the rate of one magic point per minute once the spell finishes.    "

        "desciption": "    This spell transports the caster and creatures (of SIZ 12-18) equal to the magnitude of the spell to a named time era via a time tunnel that opens up and instantly sucks them through to their destination.  The duration of the spell is the time that the caster and group jump forward or backwards through time.    Sorcerers usually have some knowledge about the time period they are travelling to and use an Anchor, a landmark such as a bronze statue, that exists in both the original and destination time period. If they are travelling blind without such an Anchor, the casting roll is at -25%, and the effects of a fumbled roll are even more catastrophic than the examples below suggest.    If the spell casting is failed, the caster and group still travel, but they end up in the wrong location (1D10 Km away from the anchor point) and time (1D10 time units away, the length of the time unit depends on duration, e.g. if the duration was in days, the time unit is days).    If the spell casting is fumbled, catastrophic events occur.  Here are some example events, the creative Referee is encouraged to create more:    A guardian creature from the Other World emerges through the portal and attacks the sorcerer in an attempt to close the portal.    The sorcerer, and all within 10m of them, is sucked through the portal which then promptly closes. The sorcerer is so befuddled that they cannot remember the spell for D20+D4 hours.    As above, but the sorcerer and party arrive in a completely different Time Era or even an Alternative Reality.    Sorcerers with this spell can “change” time freely without having to worry about unintentional “butterfly effect” changes or any alterations in their own existence or memory from changing “their” past.  However, regular use risks the catastrophic effects of a fumble.    "
